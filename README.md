I'm an aspiring **Software Engineer** and **Data Analyst**, currently immersing myself in the fascinating world of coding and data while working full-time and preparing for the London Marathon. 

I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My journey in software engineering has equipped me with a strong foundation in coding principles, and my interest in data analysis allows me to see the stories that data can tell. I'm excited about the intersection of these fields and the potential it holds.

In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my learning journey and growth in software engineering and data analysis.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you're interested in my work or if there's a potential project where we could collaborate, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

Skills: **Python**, **Excel**
